🚀 Setup (5 minutes)
Step 1 — Create a Telegram Bot
Open Telegram → search @BotFather → send `/newbot`
Give it a name (e.g. `PU Notifications`) and a username (e.g. `pu_notif_bot`)
Copy the Bot Token (looks like `7123456789:AAH...`)
Step 2 — Get your Chat ID
Start a chat with your new bot (send `/start`)
Open this URL in your browser (replace `YOUR_TOKEN`):
```
   https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getUpdates
   ```
Find `"chat":{"id": 123456789 ...}` — that number is your Chat ID
> **Tip:** If the result is empty, send another message to your bot and refresh.
Step 3 — Create GitHub Repository
Create a new private GitHub repository (e.g. `pu-notif-bot`)
Upload all files from this folder to the root of the repo:
```
   pu-notif-bot/
   ├── .github/
   │   └── workflows/
   │       └── notify.yml
   ├── scraper.py
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── seen.json
   └── README.md
   ```
Step 4 — Add Secrets
In your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
Add these two secrets:
Secret Name	Value
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`	Your bot token from BotFather
`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`	Your numeric chat ID
Step 5 — Enable Actions & First Run
Go to Actions tab in your GitHub repo
Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
Click "PU Notification Bot" → "Run workflow" → Run
✅ On first run, the bot will:
Scan all existing notifications and mark them as seen (without sending)
Send you a confirmation message on Telegram
From then on, only new notifications trigger alerts

⚙️ Customisation
Change check frequency
Edit `.github/workflows/notify.yml`:
```yaml
- cron: '*/15 * * * *'   # every 15 min (minimum GitHub allows)
- cron: '*/30 * * * *'   # every 30 min
- cron: '0 * * * *'      # every hour
```
Send to a Telegram group/channel
Add your bot as admin to the group/channel
Use the group's chat ID (negative number, e.g. `-1001234567890`) as `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
Reset and re-seed
Go to Actions → PU Notification Bot → Run workflow and tick "Clear seen.json and re-seed".

❓ Troubleshooting
Problem	Fix
Bot not sending messages	Check `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` secrets
Workflow not running	Make sure Actions are enabled; check cron syntax
PDF not attached	Some notifications may not have PDFs; bot sends text only
`git push` fails	Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" in repo Settings → Actions
Too many old notifications sent	Use "Run workflow → force_reseed" to reset
